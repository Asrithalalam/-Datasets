#🟦**Iris Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

##📍**Project Overview**

🔸This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset using Python. 

🔸The goal is to analyze relationships between all features, understand patterns across species, and generate visual insights. 

🔸All visualizations are automatically saved as image files inside the repository. 


##📊**Dataset Description**

🔻The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species.

🔻Numerical Features - Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width

🔻Target Variable - Species

🔻Each row represents a single flower observation.


##📍**Project Objectives**

> Analyze relationships between all numeric features

> Compare measurements across species

> Identify correlations between variables

> Generate professional visualizations


##🔸**Tools & Libraries Used**

◾Python

◾Pandas (data manipulation)

◾Matplotlib (visualization)

◾Seaborn (statistical plotting)

◾OS module (folder management)


##📉**Visualizations Generated**

This project generates and saves the following visualizations:

- Correlation Heatmap
   
- Pairplot (Feature Relationships)
  
- Scatter Plot (Petal Length vs Petal Width)
   
- Boxplot (Sepal Length by Species)
    
- Bar Plot (Average Feature Values per Species)
  
All visualizations are automatically saved inside the `visuals/` folder as PNG files.


##🔍**Key Insights**

🔺Petal measurements are strongly correlated.

🔺Petal features provide clearer species separation than sepal features.

🔺Species form distinct clusters when multiple features are considered together.


##📍**Project Demonstration**

✔️ Understanding of data cleaning

✔️ Feature relationship analysis

✔️ Correlation interpretation

✔️ Categorical vs numerical comparison

✔️ Automated visualization saving


##🚩**Conclusion**

-This project demonstrates how meaningful insights can be extracted by analyzing all features of a dataset.

-Using multiple visual techniques improves understanding of patterns and relationships within the data.
